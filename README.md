# ~~PCNN+ONE based Relation Extraction via Tensorflow Framework~~

This is a tf1.1.3 based repo which use ~~PCNN+ONE~~ to solve Relation Extraction problems. Most of the ideas borrow from [OpenNRE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE).

**NOTICE:** This is actually PCNN+MAX instead of ONE, and this repo is archived and will not be updated.

Well, I have to say, Keras is a great framework and easy to use in model stacking. But, it is not enough flexible to some self-design and research project. Maybe it is because I have not got the spirit of Keras... So I decide to use tensorflow instead of keras in this repo. You may see the former commits contains keras  code. But I have changed the code into tf already in the last commit.

This repo is not support for gpu yet, ~~but I'm working on it, since I don't have a gpu yet...~~

I am a newbie and still learning, so feel free to raise some issues and make pull requests.

## How to Use

1. download the data and organize data in a proper file dir structure
2. `python singlefile.py`
3. `tensorboard --logdir ./summary/pcnn_one_train_demo/`

## Dataset

### NYT10

> NYT10 is a distantly supervised dataset originally released by the paper "Sebastian Riedel, Limin Yao, and Andrew McCallum. Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text.". Here is the download [link](http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/) for the original data.

> We've provided a toolkit to convert the original NYT10 data into JSON format that `OpenNRE` could use. You could download the original data + toolkit from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSGYObt-SRLccvYCsWaHx1ldurp9eDN_/view?usp=sharing) or [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/11391e48b72749d8b60a/?dl=1). Further instructions are included in the toolkit.
